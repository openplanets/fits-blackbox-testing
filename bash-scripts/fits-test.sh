# Bash script to automate the regression testing of FITS.
#
# author Carl Wilson carl@openplanetsfoundation.org
# 
# This initial cut is intended to be run from the root 
# directory of a FITS development branch.  Given the path
# to a FITS testing tool and a path to test corpora the script:
#
#	* Checks that there's no uncommitted code.
#   * Checks that you're not on master.
#	* Builds the current branch and generates test output.
#   * Checks out the master commit that's the source of this branch.
#	* Builds FITS and generates the more test output.
#	* Use the FITS testing tool to compare the output.
#	* If successful, i.e. the output is unchanged report success.
#   * If unsuccessful use git-bisect to find the last good commit.
#
# The FITS testing tool should be a command line application 
# that tests 2 sets of FITS generated output and returns:
#
#  0     If the tests succeed
#
#  1-124 If the tests fail
#
#  125   If the tests cannot be performed
#
# These values are for use with git bisect run command
# https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html

#
# usage: fits-test [-t <path>] [-c <path>] [-b] [-h|?]
# Options:

#  -c <path>  run tests on corpora at directory <path>, REQUIRED.
#  -b         invoke git-bisect if test against merge base fails.
